<h2>YaST2 Runlevel Editor Configuration Tool</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<P><ul>
<li>setting default runlevel</li>
<li>setting which runlevels services run in</li>
</ul>
</P>
<H3>Pre-requisites</H3>
<P>
Runlevel editor strongly depends on SuSE Linux conventions. Expected
<tt>/etc/inittab</tt> format:<ul>
<li><b>Default runlevel:</b> is read from line <tt>^id:.:initdefault:</tt> where
it is supposed that default runlevel is at the place of .</li>
<li><b>List of runlevels:</b> It is supposed that runlevels are changed via
running script <tt>/etc/init.d/rc</tt>. So to get list of runlevels we search
for parameters given to this script, because this script expects runlevel name
as an argument. We search for: 
<tt>/^[^#]..*\/etc\/init\.d\/rc ARGUMENT</tt>. </li>
</ul>
<b>Current runlevel</b> is read from output of <tt>/sbin/runlevel</tt>.<br>
List of <b>init scripts</b> is obtained from <tt>/etc/init.d/</tt>. Some names
are skipped, because they are not init scripts: <tt>core, README, rc, rx,
*.rpm*, *.ba*, *~, ... </tt>. For each init script, comment is read and default 
runlevels and description are taken from it. See
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/gLSB/gLSB/initscrcomconv.html">
LSB</a> for specification of init script comments. Current settings, which mean
list of runlevels service is started in is taken from <tt>/etc/init.d/rc?.d</tt>
subdirectories. E.g. if there is a script <tt>/etc/init.d/rc5.d/S08network</tt>
then it means that service <tt>network</tt> is started in runlevel 5.<br>
<b>Service status</b> is obtained by running <tt>initscript status</tt>.<br>
</P>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<P>
Now as we have all settings read, we may change them. Changing default runlevel
is straightforward. Just pick a new value from combobox. Note that this setting
means which runlevel system switches to after boot!!! So this option has no
immediate effect. <br>
<b>Detailed service editation</b> enable changing which runlevels service runs
in. Some special options are available:
FIXME: WILL WE USE START_VARIABLES?
<ul>
<li><b>Reset to default</b> which resets service to state after installation. If
service was installed disabled, it will be disabled after this action!</li>
<li><b>Reset all services to default</b> does the same for all services.</li>
<li><b>Enable the service</b> enables disabled service and lets it run in
runlevels default for it. If you want to know which runlevels are default to
service, look into its init script
(<tt>/etc/init.d/service_name_as_seen_in_runlevel_editor</tt>).</li> 
</ul>
All above settings are saved after button [Finish] is pressed. But following
operations happen immediately: 
<ul>
<li><b>Start service</b></li>
<li><b>Stop service</b></li>
<li><b>Refresh status</b></li> 
</ul>
</P>
<h3>Saving</h3>
<P>
Default runlevel is saved to the same place it was read from. <br>
Services are saved using
<br>
<tt>/sbin/insserv -r servicename</tt><br>
<tt>/sbin/insserv servicename,start=list_of_runlevels</tt><br>
</P>
