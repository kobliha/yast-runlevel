* Bug report: "If I start service foo, yast hangs!"

It may be a case of a daemon that does not detach itself from its
controlling terminal.

Seen in bugs 16323 (scanlogd), 21773 (mysql)
On command line, do rcfoo start
ps ax |grep foo
ls -l /proc/$pid/fd
 will probably show a fd attached to the terminal.
Or try rcfoo start 2>&1 |cat	 # 22836 (pure-ftpd)
